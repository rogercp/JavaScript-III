/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. This binds to the window when it is not pointing to any other object.

* 2. This implicitly bind to objects which means that it is automatic.

* 3. The new keyword allows the this keyword to bind to an objects properties and methods to the left
    of the dot when creating a new function.

* 4. This can also be binded in an explicit manner with methods in order to manually
    set which object the 'this' keyword binds to.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
